### Ending Notes üìù

- Nothing completely new was learned but this project gave me some good experience considering this had a fair amount of elements. Up until now most of the projects i have done were component projects or coming soon pages with a far less number of elements than this. So this was a good opportunity to apply and practice the things i have been learning so far.
- On the design file there was an overflow effect on the hero image, i struggled a lot to achieve it, and with some help managed to get it to a working state. But in the end i ended up not using it. I liked the current solution without any overflowing effect on the image.
- Used a negative margin to position the overlapping number 2 at the bottom.
- Used a pseudo element to get the overlay color on section 2. Initially i tried the `background-blend-mode` property but couldn't get the exact color in the design file. So went with the pseudo element which gave the result that was needed.
- There were couple of places where the color contrast wasn't passing the check, but i didn't want to change the colors in the design. As a result, couldn't hit the 100% mark on the lighthouse accessibilty test.
- Overall it was a nice project. I loved this design, loved the colors and the layout. There were some minor inconsistencies in the design file values which i think could have been avoided but it was ok. The only thing i didn't like was the hero image overflow which i spent too much time trying to make it work.
